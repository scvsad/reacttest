Just fyi there's a lot of this that can be skipped now, as @getas12 linked to the create react app that facebook has created so you don't have to sort out webpack and all that stuff, here's a super quick way to get set up and started (i know it's not gna include everything, but it'll get a react-redux structure up and running for you...

First if you haven't already run "npm install -g create-react-app"  this gives you the ability to create react apps with one line of code..
Secondly create a react app by navigating to the folder in which you want it to be (eg Sites) and run "create-react-app app-name" replacing app-name with the name of your app, this will be the name of the project folder. Anywhere you see app-name in these instructions, replace with your app name.
then "cd app-name" and "npm i redux --save"  and "npm i react-redux â€”save" these are the two essentials for getting react and redux working together.
For good project setup cd into src and run "mkdir actions components reducers" to set up folders to separate out the code nicely, then create a store.js in the src folder.

Following all this cd back up to your project folder and run "npm start" to see your app at http://localhost:3000
For deployment ready, minified code run "npm run build" this creates the code in a build folder.
